            <p>This operator showed up one day at the office as Record Scratch, requesting to join and be hired. 
                Despite his lack of previous experience, his determination to learn how to fight has landed him a 
                spot in the reserve operators’ list. He displayed an unfaltering willingness to adapt to a new 
                lifestyle as an operator for Rhodes Island. An investigation shows potential in his physical and 
                mental capabilities, proving him worthy of joining our cause as a soldier and possible test subject.</p>

            <p>Imaging tests reveal blurry outlines of this operator's internal organs, clouded with abnormal dark 
                spots. His circulatory system shows an abnormally high rate of Originium particulate matter, with 
                other signs of Oripathy infection, we can confirm that the operator is indeed Infected. He doesn't 
                seem too bothered by this, though.</p>
            
            <p>[Cell-Originium Assimilation] 0.7%<br />
                Operator Record has no visible Originium crystallization on his body's surface. However, three dark 
                streaks up the side of his hip may be attributed to Originium-based scars.</p>

                Operator Record’s infection has been stabilized. Again, he seemed quite nonchalant about this and 
                thanked the doctors on his way out.</p>

            <p>“His vibrant clothing and constant smile brought an upbeat atmosphere to our base, and he quickly 
                began chatting with other operators as soon as he arrived. Some operators regarded him with 
                distrust and uneasiness, but he shows no ill will with the information he learned about the others. 
                He seemed to gravitate towards people who become engrossed in their work, such as operators 
                dedicated to taking care of cats, an operator with a passion for literature, and another operator 
                interested in accumulating an arsenal of weapons. He never talked about himself, though, and when 
                I questioned it, he laughed it off and told me that he had a musical background, but won’t elaborate.</p>

            <p>“A very strange operator, but nonetheless one you can rely on, whether it’s to talk to or to assign 
                him to tasks. He’s helpful around the medics and researchers, always offering to do heavy lifting 
                when he’s not training. Sometimes, he asks about our research, and while most of it sounds boring, 
                he listens intently and seems to remember for the next conversation. There is genuinity in him, but 
                still, I don’t feel as if I can trust him fully.”</p>

            <p>It's quite strange. Record was reported to have a very strict regiment; 06:00 to wake, and 22:00 to 
                bed. His routine is marked by the clock, from training to eating to working. Anyone could see that 
                he did everything to the best of his ability, even if it was difficult to see his eyes through his 
                sunglasses.</p>

            <p>That's not the strange part. The really weird part is how in TERRA does someone like him keep such 
                a rigid schedule!? Operators have seen him sponge-skate down the hallway, switch out sugar for salt, 
                and replace perfectly good pie filling with toothpaste. There were also numerous reports about 
                Operator Record enabling dangerous behavior such as burning down another operators' headquarters. 
                When questioned, he only shrugged and said he helped calculate the medical bills and damage costs 
                if they really went forward with their idea, and that he had no other part in carrying out the plan. 
                Ridiculous! Such lack of self restraint seems so uncharacteristic of him!</p>

            <p>Record Scratch. Noun. The sound of a phonograph needle scraping against a record, causing an interruption 
                and calling immediate attention. </p>

            <p>Record Scratch. Proper noun. An operator who has mastered the art of interrupting people who pry about his 
                past by calling immediate attention to the present.</p>

            <p>We found an old pamphlet with an image of a young musician holding a violin. The pages were practically 
                falling apart, but the "Allen Bach" in large font was unmistakable. At first, we thought it was one of his 
                relatives, or a sibling perhaps, because he had never talked about his family before. Lots of performances 
                showed up when we looked up the name. He had nicknames such as "rising star" and "natural talent", but the 
                most bizarre news that showed up said "Disappearance of Allen Bach." His last performance scheduled was 
                never heard. Apparently, he didn't even show up. We would have read more if we weren't suddenly jump scared 
                by Record's sudden appearance in our office.</p>
            <p>'I was looking for papers for Finn, but I see that you found some private information.'</p>

            <p>We weren't sure if he was upset (it's hard to tell through those sunglasses!), so we tried apologizing, but 
                he waved it off.</p>
            <p>'That's in the past now. Allen Bach doesn't play anymore. Ah, you're so tense! Relax a bit! Life's too 
                short to get hung up on something like this!'</p>
            <p>We were stunned silent as he beatboxed on his way out.</p>

            <p>"Is this thing recording? Testing, one, two, th— ow! Why'd I get smacked!? I've always wanted to do this! 
                Let me have this, just once!</p>

            <p>"Ahem. I was one of the investigators that looked into Operator A— Record's history. We wanted to learn 
                more about him properly this time, without snooping around and all that. Wait, this still sounds like we 
                were snooping. We weren't!"</p>

            <p>There's an awkward cough.</p>

            <p>"I-I didn't really want to pry into his past anymore after that incident. What I was in charge of was 
                finding out if he was a detriment to our operation, put bluntly and simply. After all, usually people 
                who have a past to hide can't be fully trusted, especially if they can maneuver out of it skillfully.</p>

            <p>"On my way to the kitchen, I saw him pouring salt into the correct container and filling up the fridge 
                with various frozen vegetables and meat; when I asked what he was doing, he offhandedly mentioned an 
                operator who frequented the kitchen said that they were running low. </p>

            <p>"Curious, I asked him why there were rumors about him being okay with his fellow operators being 
                endangered if he was willing to go out of his way to restock food for them. He probably sensed that 
                I was looking for a serious answer or else I wouldn't leave him alone. It still surprised me that he 
                replied with what seemed like so much sincerity that it almost felt uncharacteristic of him.</p>

            <p>'"When people set their mind to something, they'll do anything they can to achieve that goal,' he said. 
                'All I can do is remind them of the consequences and be there if they need to be carried back to the 
                emergency room. And even then that's not guaranteed! But most people I talk to already knew that.'</p>

            <p>"I wanted to know what kinds of goals he had, but he laughed it off and said it was to get some lunch 
                for a medic friend. While he walked away, it made me think a bit; I can't say I completely agree with 
                him, but he doesn't strike me as an individual who would purposefully let others get hurt. After all, 
                he did write up a rather detailed medical bill detailing injuries that could be sustained. He must 
                have paid very close attention to those medic operators who rambled on about boring medical stuff.</p>

            <p>"Well, case closed, then. Operator Record is not a harmful individual. We'll keep an eye on him, though."</p>
