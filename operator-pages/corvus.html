            Corvus has often been described as an intimidating operator who rarely speaks unprompted; when he does speak, it’s done with abundantly eloquent speech that often confuses other operators. His worldview is distinctively pessimistic, and his rare philosophical speeches are long drawn—in other words, Corvus is a highly eccentric character that is hard to approach. He is often mistaken for someone who is unwilling to cooperate, when in reality he merely finds it difficult to approach new people. In any case, Corvus takes orders well and with a bit of time, will warm up to just about any operator.

            It became almost immediately apparent that Corvus had inherited his family’s passion for literature, as he had instantly volunteered to maintain Rhodes Islands’s library upon onboarding. Within his first few weeks, dozens upon dozens of new books were added to the library’s collection, mostly containing renowned works from famous authors with heavy emphasis on the macabre. He was enthusiastic to receive and sort any donations from other operators, and the library has grown to have an impressive range from poetry to comic books to even children’s books. He recently began a book club, apparently excited to hear about the thoughts of other operators to widen his world view. In his words, “There is no such thing as a wrong question or a wrong answer. Even ignorance has something worth learning from.”

            When Corvus is not reading, he is writing; when he is not writing, he is reading. Despite the complications caused by his Oripathy, Corvus makes it a point to practice writing with his affected hand regardless. He has several journals filled with poems he had written, although his latest journal appears to be written with different handwriting. When asked about it, he stated that he still had to learn how to write with his left hand proficiently. 

          <p>  “His poems? They’re good, but also like, really scary for some reason? There was one about someone getting their eyes pecked out, one about some bleeding floorboards, one about getting trapped in a wine cellar…. I mean it’s kind of freaky, but I think he’s still a nice guy. He told me how he wanted to write a novel one day, but couldn’t work on it anymore because of his hand. He seemed okay about it, I think. I’m not sure—he’s a hard guy to read.”

            <p>Despite Corvus’s fascination with death, he had only personally encountered it once before his onboarding at Rhodes Island. His family manor was invaded by a coordinated team of intruders, and Corvus became an unfortunate victim; his right hand had suffered a deep wound from an Originium weapon and subsequently became infected. He managed to kill the intruders, and joined Rhodes Island for his treatment, but will hardly ever speak of the incident. When prompted further, Corvus was unusually frank, sparing very little details. “I took the lives of men,” he had said. “There is nothing more to it. I do not wish to take death so lightly, even in self-defense.” 
            </p>
            <p> Regarding his hand, Corvus deemed it a cruel twist of fate that his writing hand became so badly damaged when he began work on his novel. However, he refused to give up writing despite his injuries and overworked his hand until its condition had worsened considerably. He has reported that it is stiff and numb, unable to feel temperature or pain. Although he can still use it, its motor functions deteriorate considerably after extended use without rest. Currently, he is undergoing physical therapy and treatment for his right hand, though the damages done to it may never heal. </p>
           <p>Nonetheless, Corvus recently began practicing writing with his non-dominant hand. Though nowhere nearly as eloquent looking as his former handwriting, Corvus himself stated that there was a certain type of beauty in hardship. </p>
