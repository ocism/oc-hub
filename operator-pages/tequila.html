            <p>He was taken to Rhodes Island by a person who had clashed with him just a few
                days prior. Even in the face of such an embarrassing situation, he still
                behaved as if nothing had happened, maintaining a friendly and jovial social
                atmosphere along the way. Truly, Operator Tequila is a rare diplomatic talent
                fitting for one who serves the Mayor of Dossoles.</p>

            <p>After arriving at Rhodes Island, Operator Tequila seemed to adapt to his new lifestyle

                He always uses a disarming attitude, cleverly proposing solutions that are amenable to
                everyone.</p>

            <p>His outstanding communication abilities seem innate and do not seem to burden him. Some
                operators compared Tequila to other operators who are good communicators and were
                surprised to find that Operator Tequila always seems to have a hearty smile and a
                friendly attitude. Nobody seems to have ever seen Operator Tequila display any negative
                emotions.</p>

            <p>However, there is no such thing as a person who never experiences negative emotions, and
                some of the operators who've been in contact with him are persistently worried about this.</p>

            <p><em>Increase Trust to 100.</em></p>

            <p>The young Perro named Ernesto Salas was born into a military family in Bolívar. His
                father, Pancho Salas, joined the 'True Bolívarians' local resistance force because
                of his patriotic ideals, leaving behind his wife and his son.</p>

            <p>During the long years during which his father never came home, fighting for Bolívar's
                independence, Mrs. Salas suffered from a vicious illness that claimed her life after
                a prolonged struggle that almost lasted a year, leaving the young Ernesto alone. It
                was not until Ernesto had finished taking care of his mother's funeral that Pancho
                Salas suddenly appeared at his doorstep.</p>
            
            <p>After that, his father took Ernesto away from his hometown and followed the army
                through Bolívar. He was sent to join a True Bolívarians prep team, receiving
                professional military training along with a group of similarly-aged youths. After
                suffering defeat on the battlefield eight years ago, the old soldier brought Ernesto
                and Rafaela to Dossoles after three years of drifting and laid dormant within the city,
                hoping to stage a comeback.</p>
            
            <p>Compared to Operator La Pluma, who is more pure-hearted, Ernesto has a substantially
                deeper and more complex view on many things. His five years of living in Dossoles
                allowed the young man to fully integrate into the city, and the ideas of indulging in
                freedom and the supremacy of hedonism have had a profound influence upon him. His
                experiences working under the Mayor have undoubtedly changed his viewpoints regarding
                various matters.</p>

            <p><em>Increase Trust to 150.</em></p>

            <p>Operator Tequila quickly accomplished two things at Rhodes Island:</p>

            <p>First, he improved the wine-tasting ability of many operators. In his spare time, he
                occasionally appears in the bar to introduce various wines to the other operators,
                finding something suiting their tastes. When a bartender is present, his sister La Pluma
                in particular, he demonstrates his knowledge of mixed drinks as well and introduces them
                to other patrons. After all, it is well known that though La Pluma is an excellent
                bartender, she seldom takes the initiative to talk.</p>

            <p>Second, after joining Rhodes Island, he found that the company does not object to
                operators maintaining their own interests outside of work, and as such, he planned to
                continue operating his weapons shop on the ship — unlike the situation in Dossoles, the
                mobility of the Rhodes Island landship makes it easier to purchase high-quality equipment
                from various places. In front of the operators who come to his doorstep as customers,
                Tequila provides serious recommendations to each guest depending on their actual
                circumstances and needs. Furthermore, Tequila seems to have made significant inroads with
                the skilled craftspeople of Rhodes Island, and perhaps the modification and customization
                of weapons will soon be on the agenda.</p>
                
            <p><br />From the two things above, Operator Tequila clearly demonstrated an adept and
                ingenious ability to leverage his social skills, bringing his entrepreneurial temperament
                along with him, well-deserving of his former job as the deputy director of the Dossoles
                International Trade Management Department.</p>
            
            <p>However, there are certain individuals in Rhodes Island who he struggles to get along with,
                and Dobermann, an operator from Bolívar, is one such individual. The atmosphere between
                Tequila and Dobermann was rather tense when they first met. However, Dobermann, who hailed
                from the same country as him, had more convoluted experiences there than he did, and had
                a more profound understanding of Bolívar, ironically may have understood Tequila, who
                hides all kinds of complex thoughts behind a smile, better than anyone else at Rhodes
                Island. In fact, Dobermann easily saw through his facade and came to regard him as a young
                man from the same motherland, worthy of nurturing, and keeps a close eye on him. This makes
                Dobermann one of the few people who can make Tequila visibly squirm.</p>

            <p>Regarding the events that occurred during the Dossoles championship, Operator Ch'en has
                already briefly explained the causes and consequences to us in a report, specifically
                mentioning why she would recommend Tequila and Rafaela to Rhodes Island.</p>
                
            <p>Pancho Salas's long-planned plot fell short, and he will spend a long time in prison as a
                result. However, Mayor Candela Sanchez saw the championship as a great boon for viewership,
                and as a result, granted amnesty to all the people participating in the plot with the
                exception of Pancho, instead removing them from their posts and exiling them, an irony not
                lost upon us.</p>
            
            <p>The siblings, Tequila and La Pluma, were faced with an uncertain future, and Operator Ch'en,
                after great deliberation, finally decided to recommend the two of them to Rhodes Island.
                Ch'en believed that she was in no position to pass judgment on Tequila's actions, and also
                recognized that Tequila was undergoing his own internal struggle. As such, she gave Ernesto
                the option of trying to apply to Rhodes Island through the newly-established regional branch
                in Dossoles. In the end, Tequila and La Pluma came to Rhodes Island together.</p>
            
                <p>What must be noted is that if Ernesto was the type of person who could disregard the lives
                    of civilians in order to further his own ends, Rhodes Island absolutely would have turned
                    him down.</p>
                
                <p>However, we can rely on Ch'en's pieced-together account of the incident to understand some
                    of Ernesto's thought process. Old Pancho's plan was very difficult to execute, and in order
                    to enable him to smoothly coordinate with the available outside forces, Ernesto, who was
                    in placed in charge of directing the operation, had to attract the attention of the Mayor
                    as well as that of other unexpected players. He had to instigate a certain degree of panic
                    within Dossoles, and also needed to apply sufficient psychological duress on Mayor Candela.
                    To accomplish these ends, Ernesto commanded his subordinates to place a considerable amount
                    of explosives in residential areas... Ch'en's views on these actions are as follows: At that
                    time, the residential area had been temporarily expropriated due to the championship being
                    held, and all residents had been evacuated before the games. In theory, that area would've
                    been the least populated place in Dossoles during that time.</p>
                
                <p>Of course, this is not to say that Ernesto's guilt should be lessened in any capacity, nor is
                    this to defend him. However, after taking stock of the situation after the fact, we can at
                    least make a definite conclusion:</p>
                
                <p>Ernesto Salas was not interested in creating a moving heap of rubble. Nor did he want corpses
                    strewn everywhere.</p>

                <p>Perhaps as a result of the wars he had seen in his youth and his knowledge of their cruelty,
                    Ernesto did not want to become like the armies in his memories, treating corpses and
                    destruction as trophies to be shown off.</p>

            <p><em>Upgrade to Elite LV2.</em></p>

            <p>The personality that we observed in this young man is not quite as sunny and hearty as the side he
                displays. We were able to discover this without much difficulty when he didn't try to cover it up
                from us too much.</p>

            <p>Operator Tequila thinks about both his own experiences and also the experiences of the people around
                him to a great extent, and to be able to maintain this is rare indeed. Obviously, Ernesto disagrees
                with some of Old Pancho's ideas, but nevertheless, chose to aid his father throughout the Dossoles
                incident.</p>

            <p>As for Ernesto Salas, the turmoil of Dossoles and the failure of Pancho Salas was a turning point
                that helped him make up his mind. Now, the youth have convinced themselves that they've freed
                themselves from the will and control of the previous generation, and are determined to pave their
                own way.</p>

            <p>This way may branch off in a completely different direction than the last generation, but Ernesto
                has always admitted that he belongs to Bolívar and will likely return there in the future. If there
                are more young people like him, the situation in Bolívar may experience new change as well.</p>
            
            <p>This young man is trying to grasp his own destiny, and we are keenly interested in seeing where this
                leads him.</p>
