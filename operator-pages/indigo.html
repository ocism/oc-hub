                    go hungry for long.

                    Life inside the lighthouse was hardly boring at all. The seas are always
                    changing. However, my teacher drove me out of the lighthouse, and said to
                    me, 'If you don't see more of this world, you won't be able to protect even
                    a small corner of the sea.' That's how I made my way here.

                    Some people say this light is Originium Arts, but according to my teacher, this
                    is a power that originates from my heart. With the light's guidance, those who
                    sail through the foggiest nights will be able to resist the raging tides and find
                    the correct bearing. That is why I will do my best to protect this light.
