            <p>He's open to sharing just about everything he has, from his sweets to his skills to his past. 
                Anything you ask of him, he'll do it if he could, or he'll find a way to make it happen. This 
                includes readily confessing to things that aren't his fault and cleaning up messes that he didn't 
                cause.</p>

            <p>You see, justice seems to be of utmost importance to him to where it becomes almost akin to vengeance. 
                In essence, when someone is wronged, he will step up and sully his hands to make sure that wrongdoers 
                meet their punishment. Situations range from scolding an operator for an hour to lighting another 
                operators' room on fire. Such extreme acts of vengeance have no place in this situation. There are no 
                black and white sides to a war.</p>
            
            <p>There are no right or wrong sides in a war.</p>

            <p>It is easy to conclude, then, Operator Salvation's nature of vengeance is a villain's methods disguised with 
                a hero's intent. Isn't that how the story goes?</p>

            <p>Ah, here; his story goes like this:</p>

            <p>Once upon a time, a young Sankta was bestowed the gift of a moral compass. He often sought company from others 
                to find the meaning of his gift. Throughout his life, it became apparent that classes and teachers and tutors 
                and classmates paid no attention to his gift. They loved him for his gentle heart, steadfast in the face of 
                turmoil and conflict. A making of a hero.</p>
                
            <p>But heroes are not exempt from the Laterano law. Heroes, too, must face their punishment as ordinary citizens.</p>
                
            <p>Someone took it a bit too far with one of his dearest friends, a young Liberi who cowered and fled when danger 
                approached too closely. The Sankta, armed with a shotgun and a desire to protect, shot a fellow wingéd citizen. 
                His own wings became marred, and his own halo cracked. He knew what he had done, and he knew what he must do.</p>
                
            <p>Letters stuffed with farewells and tears dotted doors to his friends' and families' homes. They tried to look out 
                the window, to see where their beloved guardian angel had gone.</p>
                
            <p>But as the chapter closes, so does Aeolian's entry back to Laterano.</p>

            <p>Must you prod at me for another tale? Alright, alright, it goes as follows:</p>

            <p>Neither hero nor villain, Operator Salvation bears no ill will towards his past. He writes 
                letters to his friends and family back in a promised land he cannot return to. Often, he 
                meditates by his room, breathing deeply when others walk by and breathing shakily when he 
                thinks he's alone.</p>
                
            <p>But he's never truly alone. A broken soul does not mend without help from others.</p>
                
            <p>His first friend finds him in the kitchen, her little paws silently following a trail to his 
                meal. Following her is another operator, eyes full of grief from a past of sorrow. And then 
                another friend, another pair, and several others learn to find comfort at his side.</p>
                
            <p>He learns to love their presence, and in turn, they piece his soul back together.</p>
                
            <p>Not the loud parading ending suited for a hero, see, but a soft ending suited for Aeolian. Don't you think?
