Operator Profile


Operator Salvation, a single-target caster who swore off guns despite his excellent marksmanship. He's no stranger to a good fight, that's for sure, although he prefers to spend his time fixing machines and baking goods.

Clinical Analysis

There's not much to say about him. Aeolian, operator name Salvation, nicknamed "Salv" by other operators, has a quiet nature that blends him into the background. Hair in his face, eyes always closed or downcast, you'll rarely see them, much less make eye contact.
He's open to sharing just about everything he has, from his sweets to his skills to his past. Anything you ask of him, he'll do it if he could, or he'll find a way to make it happen. This includes readily confessing to things that aren't his fault and cleaning up messes that he didn't cause.
Really, we don't know what to say about him. What is there to say about such an unassuming presence?

Increase to 100.
Upon closer inspection, it seems that Operator Salvation's unassuming presence gives way to tell multiple stories underneath the calm waters.

One of which has to do with his fiery temper. 

You see, justice seems to be of utmost importance to him to where it becomes almost akin to vengeance. In essence, when someone is wronged, he will step up and sully his hands to make sure that wrongdoers meet their punishment. Situations range from scolding an operator for an hour to lighting another operators' room on fire. Such extreme acts of vengeance have no place in this situation. There are no black and white sides to a war.

There are no right or wrong sides in a war.

It is easy to conclude, then, Operator Salvation's nature of vengeance is a villain's methods disguised with a hero's intent. Isn't that how the story goes?

Increase at 150 trust.
Ah, here; his story goes like this:

Once upon a time, a young Sankta was bestowed the gift of a moral compass. He often sought company from others to find the meaning of his gift. Throughout his life, it became apparent that classes and teachers and tutors and classmates paid no attention to his gift. They loved him for his gentle heart, steadfast in the face of turmoil and conflict. A making of a hero.

But heroes are not exempt from the Laterano law. Heroes, too, must face their punishment as ordinary citizens.

Someone took it a bit too far with one of his dearest friends, a young Liberi who cowered and fled when danger approached too closely. The Sankta, armed with a shotgun and a desire to protect, shot a fellow wingéd citizen. His own wings became marred, and his own halo cracked. He knew what he had done, and he knew what he must do.

Letters stuffed with farewells and tears dotted doors to his friends' and families' homes. They tried to look out the window, to see where their beloved guardian angel had gone.

But as the chapter closes, so does Aeolian's entry back to Laterano.

Increase at 200 trust.
Must you prod at me for another tale? Alright, alright, it goes as follows:

Neither hero nor villain, Operator Salvation bears no ill will towards his past. He writes letters to his friends and family back in a promised land he cannot return to. Often, he meditates by his room, breathing deeply when others walk by and breathing shakily when he thinks he's alone.

But he's never truly alone. A broken soul does not mend without help from others.

His first friend finds him in the kitchen, her little paws silently following a trail to his meal. Following her is another operator, eyes full of grief from a past of sorrow. And then another friend, another pair, and several others learn to find comfort at his side. 

He learns to love their presence, and in turn, they piece his soul back together.

Not the loud parading ending suited for a hero, see, but a soft ending suited for Aeolian. Don't you think?

please give me some time to update this i want to give salv many friends

(note; thats just what i call discarded writing that ur free to read but this isnt necessarily canon or even in character, its just old writing)

Code name: Salvation
Real name: [redacted]
Age: 29
Species: Sankta for 1 more week
Weapon: Arts-fueled stick (and possibly a slingshot)

Quick background (cw stalking):
Salvation grew up in an average family as an only child His mother worked at a bakery, and his father worked at a weapons manufacturer, so both of them weren’t exceedingly rich but weren’t poor either. They had enough to support him, send him to school, and earn his guns. Afterwards, he set off into the working world. Salvation had an unnamed Aegir friend who introduced him to a long-lasting friendship. Years later, one of the friend group members started to be stalked by another person; usually the group could still enjoy their outings and have fun because they’re ride or die buddies and they reassured the member that nothing would happen to her. Nearly a decade into their friendship, it got to the point where the stalker left threats wherever they predicted she would go. In order to put an end to this, Salvation agreed to kill the stalker, who turned out to be a Sankta, and then fled, leaving behind his dearest friends and family.

Now, he’s at Rhodes to seek refuge and to aid in their mission against the Reunion. He has nothing left to lose and will dirty his hands so no one else has to do the dirty work. 

Some side notes:
He will be your saving grace; you can blame your faults on him, and he will admit to guilt as quickly as a child would agree to taking their favorite candy.
Quiet mostly! Smiles around people he considers friends
Is actually really afraid of the law being enacted on him and won’t know what to do when he fully grows his horns and loses his wings; his halo is already starting to crack and fade
Misses his parents dearly and wishes to write back to them, as well as his friends
Loves flowers; will spend unhealthy amounts of time in the garden
speaks softly and courteously
Knows how to bake fudge and make chocolate shapes
Extremely prone to being a doormat, but if you hurt his friends he won’t hesitate to beat you up
I wanted a character that doesn’t open his eyes so here he is
Single target caster
LOVES FRIENDS, LOVES PEOPLE, HE JUST DOESN’T SAY IT MUCH even if he kind of really wants to
Stuck at 2nd place in mario kart
He’s fond of Omen’s cats! Likes baking with omen and tries to suggest alternatives to Omen eating raw eggs
Considers Opal like an older brother and stops by to offer him sweets often

Gay man.
